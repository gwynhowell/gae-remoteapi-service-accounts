# gae-remoteapi-service-accounts
A util script to use gae remote api with service accounts

This is an extension to the example shown [here](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/remoteapi#using_the_remote_api_in_a_local_client), which uses the gcloud util app for auth.
I find this an quicker and easier way of running Remote API scripts across my different apps.
